Design annoatations
--------------
By design, will use global $edd_options to store site wide admin and wallet.
As, multiple campaigns could be filling the cart and only one redirection to validation card web server, payment will go to site wallet and then distributed to campaigns wallets.
Also, every wallet created will be owned by site admin, although every campaigns stores its owner and wallet. This is to avoid loosing data on changing campaigns author.
