mangopay_edd_plugin_web
==================

EasyDigitalDownloads Mangopay gateway (94% compatible with Campaignify)(Mangopay SDKv2) by web payment method.


Workflow
----
Once the plugin is configured, use it as any other EDD payment gateway. Notice that the gateway won't appear on *Campaigns|Settings|Gateways|Payment Gateways* check box list until it is fully configured.

By design, will use global $edd_options to store site wide admin and wallet. This is because multiple campaigns could be filling the cart and only one redirection to validation card web server is done, so payment will go to 'site wallet' and then distributed to 'campaigns wallets'. This is also designed to implement, in the future, 'all or nothing' compatibility with Crowdfunding plugin. Once you set a Wordpress user as site admin, initialization procedure will attempt to generate a wallet.

Get the id's as:
- $edd_options['mwpw_mangopay_wallets_owner_id']
- $edd_options['mwpw_site_admin_wp_id']
- $edd_options['mwpw_mangopay_site_wallet_id']

Also, notice that every created wallet will be owned by site admin, although every campaigns stores its owner and wallet. This is to avoid loosing data on changing campaigns author. However, 'wallet class' constructor is waiting for you to override this.

PayOut will be withdrawed to campaign's author, once profile/bank section is filled. Remember that MangoPay staff will process manually de bank transfer.

Then, WP_users, and WP_posts objects will be completed with fields as follows:

Site admin WP_user:
 - mangopay_id 	(int) 	MangoPay\User (legal or natural) id => It will be generated on user profile.
 - wallet_id 	(int) 	MangoPay\Wallet id => It will be generated on plugin initialization.

Post author WP_user:
 - mangopay_id 	(int)	MangoPay\User (legal or natural) id It will be generated on user profile.
 - bank_id	(int)	MangoPay\BankAccount id => It will be generated on user profile.

Campaign, type='download' WP_post:
 - wallet_id	(int)	MangoPay\Wallet id => It will be generated on first payment to wallet (see 'mwpw_distribute_funds()' function on 'mwpw_pay' class)
