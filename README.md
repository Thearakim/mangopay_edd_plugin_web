MangoPay Wordpress Plugin Web (MWPW)
==================

EasyDigitalDownloads Mangopay gateway (94.7% compatible with Campaignify)

Mangopay SDKv2 [implementing **web payment method**].

Workflow
----
Once the plugin is configured, **use it as any other EDD payment gateway**. Notice that the gateway won't appear on *wp-admin|Campaigns|Settings|Gateways|Payment Gateways* check box list until it is fully configured.

By design, will use global *$edd_options* to store site wide admin and wallet. This is because multiple campaigns could be filling the cart and only one redirection to validation card web server is done, so **payment will go to 'site wallet' and then distributed to 'campaigns wallets'**. This is also designed to implement, in the future, 'all or nothing' compatibility with Crowdfunding plugin. Once you set a *WP_user* as site admin, initialization procedure will attempt to generate a wallet. Get the id's as:
- $edd_options['mwpw_mangopay_wallets_owner_id']
- $edd_options['mwpw_site_admin_wp_id']
- $edd_options['mwpw_mangopay_site_wallet_id']

Also, notice that **every created wallet will be owned by site admin**, although every campaign stores its owner and wallet. This is to avoid loosing data on changing campaigns author. However, 'wallet class' constructor is waiting for you to override this.

**PayOut will be withdrawed to campaign's author**, once *wp-admin|Profile|MangoPay User|MangoPay bank account for payout* section is filled. **See *MangoPay fundraisings* metabox on campaigns edit page** page where you will find a button to order withdraw. This could be easily removed if 'all_or_nothing' featured is implemented. Remember that MangoPay staff will process manually de bank transfer. Once a payout is requested, this section will be blocked until it is commited.

Then, *WP_users*, and *WP_posts* objects will be completed with fields as follows:

a) **Site admin** WP_user:

 - *mangopay_id* (int)  MangoPay\User (legal or natural) id => It will be generated on user *Profile|MangoPay User*.
 - *wallet_id*   (int)  MangoPay\Wallet id                  => It will be generated on plugin initialization; (see *mwpw_init_site()* function in *mwpw_gateway.php* file)

b) **Post author** WP_user:

 - *mangopay_id* (int)	 MangoPay\User (legal or natural) id  => It will be generated on user *Profile|MangoPay User*.
 - *bank_id*	    (int)	 MangoPay\BankAccount id              => It will be generated on user *Profile|MangoPay                                                                       User|MangoPay bank account for payout*.

c) **Campaign** type='download' WP_post:

 - *wallet_id*	  (int)	 MangoPay\Wallet id                   => It will be generated on first payment to wallet; (see *mwpw_distribute_funds()* function on *mwpw_pay* class)


Also notice that **Wordpress guests** are allowed to pay without registration. In this cases, a *MangoPay\User* will be generated but won't be linked to any *WP_user*. 

As Mangopay SDKv2 doesn't implements deleting *MangoPay\User* or *MangoPay\bankAccounts*, every time a *WP_user* changes 'user type' from *natural* to *legal* or viceversa, a new MangoPay id will be generated. Same way, if bank updates.
